## Project Requirement
- The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria: 8 and 128 characters.
- The user will recieve a confirm for:
  - Password containing special characters, numbers, lowercase, and uppercase.
  - Either 4 variables individual ones, or 3 with to LowerCase to Uppercase conversion
  - This will need to randomly generate a selection or randomly select array data, so math.random and math.floor will need to be used.
- The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.
- Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. Displaying the generated password will be written the password to the page.
